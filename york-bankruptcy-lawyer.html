<p>In bankruptcy, secured debts may be protected</p>

<p>If you are a homeowner with a mortgage, car loan or other kind of secured debt it is possible to wonder whether you could keep the property if you declare bankruptcy. While the majority of the time, yes, there are a few exceptions to the general rule. You will want to discuss your particular circumstance with an attorney and know the consequences of filing.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to know about secured loans is that it is an asset that has an obligation on the debt. If you fail to make your payments, the creditor is able to take possession of the collateral. However, they can't pursue you for bankruptcy. You are able to keep your property in the event that you pay regular payments. But the secured loan cannot be used to repay. In a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you must reaffirm your debt in order to keep your home.</p>

<p>If you're behind in your car or mortgage payments, you'll need to declare the debt as a part of your bankruptcy. This will allow you to solve your financial issues and get back on track with your payments. This will give the creditor to access your property and will lead to the loss of the value of your property.</p>

<p>Secured creditors are based on a security arrangement like a deed or trust, mortgage, or judgment lien. They can repossess your property if you do not pay your debts and can also take interest and attorney's costs from the property. It is imperative to pay back the debt after it is repossessed.</p>

<p>You can reduce your expenses by retaining your collateral. You must retain the insurance that you paid to secure the purchase and continue making your payments. Negotiate the terms of a new contract, or sell your collateral. Negotiations may be productive, leading to an increase in your debt from a creditor and extending your period of time to pay, or offering other conditions.</p>

<p>Selling your home is another option to avoid foreclosure. Certain states permit creditors to acquire the equity that you own in your property, if you're behind on your mortgage. If you're facing need of cash, selling your property could help you pay off your debt.</p>

<p>Reaffirming the debt through Chapter 7 bankruptcy is another alternative. Most debts will be wiped out by bankruptcy, but certain the liens attached to certain secured debts will not. These liens will still be visible on your credit report and will impact your credit score. Following bankruptcy, it is important to check your credit reports.</p>

<p>Certain debts are able to be paid off but they will still remain on your credit report. There is also a statute of limitation which requires a certain amount of time to be removed from your credit report. Oftentimes people think they know the rules and regulations but then find out that what they thought to be true was anything however. Rules change, and often are not explained very well. Do your research before declaring bankruptcy. While nobody wants to go through it, you should be prepared should you be forced to.</p>

<p>The bankruptcy process is confusing. One important piece of information to remember is that an automatic stay is legal measure to stop the creditor from taking any further actions against you. The debtor can stop collection activities, but you can choose not to do so. If the creditor is not satisfied with the stay, they could be able petition the court for the lifting of the stay. Look at websites such as https://www.ljacobsonlaw.com/pa/York-bankruptcy-attorney/ for more information on bankruptcy and seek professional advice to answer your questions.</p>

<p>There are numerous instances of fraud in bankruptcy. Some people are tricked into thinking they're getting help by a bankruptcy lawyer however, they are with a bigger financial mess than they thought. Always read through any fine print and really understand what it is you're signing prior to signing any legal document.</p>

<p>Exempt property from bankruptcy</p>

<p>Debtors can exempt certain property from Chapter 7 bankruptcy. These items could include clothing, furniture or even a computer.

For example in Colorado, a debtor can exempt farm equipment up to $25,000 provided that it is a source of livelihood.</p>

<p>A bankruptcy trustee may also sell non-exempt property to pay debtors. The sale is typically with a discount. The trustee pays the difference to the owner if the value of the asset is lower than the exemption amount. The amount is usually equivalent to the estimated asset value, less the costs of selling.</p>

<p>Debtors can react to objections by asking for a new hearing of the case. Sometimes the Bankruptcy Registrar may decide that there is no need for further action. However, sometimes the trustee could require additional payments.</p>

<p>A person who has committed fraud in transferring title to property could cause an opposition to discharge. Failure to record the assets that were lost in bankruptcy is another reason that can be cited.</p>
