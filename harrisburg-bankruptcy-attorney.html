<p>In bankruptcy, secured loans can be retained</p>

While the answer is generally yes, there are a few exceptions to this rule. It is recommended to discuss your particular circumstance with an attorney and be aware of the implications of filing.</p>

<p>Secured debt is a property that is an obligation to the debt. This is the first aspect you should know about it. It is possible for a creditor to repossess your collateral if you fail to make your payments however they cannot pursue you if you are in filed for bankruptcy.

<p>Although bankruptcy may help erase a lot of debts, there are a number of exceptions to the law. Certain debts cannot be automatically erased, including the debts for fraud and student loans, as well as government-funded debts and spousal maintenance.</p>

<p>Exempt property from bankruptcy</p>

<p>In a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, debtors are allowed to exempt certain property items. These items can be anything from furniture to clothing or even a computer. Exemptions are based on the worth of the item less any mortgages or liens. The rules may differ between states to the next. For instance in Colorado, a debtor is allowed to exempt farm equipment from taxation for up to $25,000 if it is a source of livelihood.</p>

<p>A bankruptcy trustee can also sell non-exempt properties to pay debtors. In most cases, this happens at a discount. If the value of the asset is lower than the exemption value, the trustee is required to pay the amount that is less to the owner. The amount paid is usually the same as the estimated value of the asset, minus the fees of the sale.</p>

<p>Liquidation of nonexempt properties following bankruptcy</p>

<p>Chapter 7 bankruptcy often includes the liquidation of non-exempt assets. The bankruptcy trustee is responsible to collect and liquidate the debtor's assets. The trustee distributes the proceeds from the sale of assets that are not exempt to creditors after the debtor has been discharged.</p>

<p>The decision of a trustee to liquidate or not liquidate an asset is contingent upon a number of factors. The expense of liquidation and the possibility that enough funds will be available should be considered by the trustee. The trustee must determine whether it is feasible to dispose of the asset. The value of the asset is to be assessed.</p>

<p>Follow the decisions of the trustee.</p>

<p>For instance, if you have a luxurious car that is worth more than the value of other belongings, you may not want to sell it. It could be difficult to find someone to buy the car.</p>

<p>Opposition to the discharge of bankruptcy</p>

<p>If you decide to file for bankruptcy, your creditors could oppose your discharge. This is known as an adversary proceeding. This is called an adversary proceeding.</p>

<p>The reasons to file an objection could be a false or misleading written statement or the misappropriation of funds acting in a fiduciary role. An objection can be filed by a creditor in the event that court's order is not adhered to. For instance, if, for example, you did not provide your tax documents in accordance with the requirements of the Bankruptcy Registrar, then your LIT may oppose your discharge.</p>

<p>Debtors may respond to objections by asking the court to reopen the case. Sometimes, the Bankruptcy Registrar will decide that there is no need for further action. However, at other times, the trustee will require additional payment.</p>

<p>An objection to discharge could occur if the debtor fraudulently transferred title to property. Failure to record the assets that were lost in bankruptcy is another common reason.</p>

<p>Procedural proceedings in formal settings can last for a long time.</p>
