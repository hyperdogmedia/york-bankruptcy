<p>In bankruptcy, secured debts can be kept</p>

<p>If you have a home mortgage, car loan or other kind of secured debt you may wonder whether you are able to keep the property even if you declare bankruptcy. While the majority of cases, it is true, there are some exceptions. It is important to speak with an attorney about your specific situation and consequences of filing.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to know regarding secured loans is that it's collateral that acts as a lien on the debt. If you do not make payments, a creditor can repossess your collateral. However, they can't claim bankruptcy against you. Your property can be kept provided you make regular payments. But you will be unable to use your secured loan can't be used to repay. If you file the case of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you will need to reaffirm your debt if you want to keep your property.</p>

<p>Reaffirm your debts under bankruptcy if you are behind on mortgage or car payments. This will let you deal with your financial difficulties and get on track with your payments. But, it could allow the creditor to seize your property, which will result in you losing the value of the property.</p>

<p>Secured creditors are based on a security agreement, such as a trust deed or mortgage, or judgment lien. If you don't pay them they may take possession of your property and collect fees and interest. Make sure that you pay back the debt after it's repossessed.</p>

<p>You could save hundreds of dollars by holding your collateral. It is important to keep the insurance you purchased to secure your purchase and keep making payments. Either negotiate a new contract or sell your collateral. Negotiations are possible and can result in your creditor reducing or lengthening the time it takes to make payments, or offering different terms.</p>

<p>Another way to stay out of foreclosure is to dispose of your property. If you're in default on your mortgage, a few states permit creditors to seize the equity in your home. Selling your property may be an option to repay your debt if you are facing an emergency situation or require the money.</p>

<p>Another option is to confirm the debt through the Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Most debts will be wiped out during bankruptcy, however certain the liens attached to certain secured debts won't be. The liens remain on your credit report and influence your credit score. After filing bankruptcy, it's important to review your credit report.</p>

Rules change and at times, they're not easily understood. Do your research before you declare bankruptcy. Nobody would ever want to do that, however, if you are in the situation you want to be sure you know everything you must know before proceeding.</p>

<p>The bankruptcy process is confusing. A key point to be aware of is that the automatic stay is a legal safeguard to stop the creditor from taking any further actions against you. The debtor has the option of stopping the collection process, but you can choose not to do so. If the creditor does not agree to this, they may be able to ask the court for the lifting of the stay.

<p>The bankruptcy process can be used to settle debts not paid. It is usually imposed by a court order. This process is designed to provide relief for debtors who are in a position to not pay the debt. There are many things to be aware of when applying for bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Discharge does not eliminate debt</p>

<p>A discharge is an order by an official of a court that states that the debtor is free of personal responsibility for a specific debt. Certain criteria have to be met to qualify for the discharge. Not all debts can be eliminated through bankruptcy.</p>

<p>While bankruptcy is a great way to remove a variety of debts, there are a range of legal exceptions. Not all debts can be erased automatically, such as student loans, fraud, government-funded debts and the spousal support.</p>

<p>Property exempt from bankruptcy</p>

<p>In the case of a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, debtors can exempt specific items of property. They can include items like clothing, furniture, or a computer. The exemptions are determined based on the item's value, less any mortgages or other loans. This rule may vary between states to another. For instance, in Colorado, a debtor can exempt farm equipment up to $25,000 if it contributes to the owner's income.</p>

<p>A bankruptcy trustee could also sell non-exempt properties to pay creditors. The sale is typically at a discount. If the value of the property is lower than the exemption amount, the trustee will pay the amount that is less to the owner. The amount paid is usually equivalent to the value estimated for the asset, minus costs of selling the asset.</p>

<p>In bankruptcy, liquidation of property that is not exempt</p>

<p>Chapter 7 bankruptcy often includes the liquidation of non-exempt assets. The bankruptcy trustee is responsible to collect and liquidate the assets of the debtor. The trustee will distribute the proceeds of the sale of non-exempt assets to creditors after the debtor is discharged.</p>

<p>The trustee has to take into consideration a range of elements before deciding to liquidate an asset or not. The expense of liquidation, as well as the probability that funds are available will be considered by the trustee. The trustee must determine whether it is feasible to sell the asset. In the end, the worth of the asset should weigh</p>

<p>Follow the advice of the trustee.</p>

<p>For example, if you own a luxury car that is worth more than the value of other belongings, you might not want to dispose of it. It may be difficult to locate a buyer to buy the car.</p>

<p>Opposition to bankruptcy discharge</p>

<p>Your creditors could object to the bankruptcy filings. This is called an adversary proceeding. This is referred to as an adversary proceeding.</p>

<p>There are a variety of reasons to object. Some could be a false or misleading written statement or the misappropriation of funds in a fiduciary capacity. A creditor may also file an objection for inability to follow an order of a court. For example, if you did not submit your tax documentation as required by the Bankruptcy Register, your LIT may oppose your discharge.</p>

<p>Debtors can respond to an objection by seeking a court's permission to reopen the case. Sometimes the Bankruptcy Registrar may decide that no further action is needed. However, at other times, the trustee will require further payments.</p>

<p>An objection to discharge can also arise if the debtor fraudulently transferred title to property. A failure to account assets that were lost during bankruptcy is another typical reason.</p>

<p>Formal proceedings can last an extended time</p>

<p>The long-term strategy of execution is one of the most difficult aspects of a formal bankruptcy.
